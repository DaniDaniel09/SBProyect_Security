# Spring Boot Project with support for Spring Security
# Made by DaniDaniel09

## This project is a simple Spring Boot Project that manages a MySQL database with 2 tables, Author and Book. It adds all of the necessary things to manage this data.
## It also adds Spring Security, but due to lack of time and not understanding much, the User and Role part is done, missing the JWT part.
